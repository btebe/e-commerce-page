## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned alot about accessibility in this challenge. I took a step back and took a course on semantic HTML and accessibility courses. It was abit of a learning curve, but i managed to incorporate it to my project. As a result, i was able to manuver the websit via keyboard. Also, i was able to make the lightbox keyboard friendly. Also, when in lightbox state, i managed to trap the focus there until the user exits it by using the focus-trap-react library.

### Continued development

I wish to continue to make future websites more accessible. whether taking more courses on the topic or watching youtube videos on how to implement it standardly.
